## Introduction

In order to improve my web development skills, I created this page as a practical exercise for my front-end course studies. Given the chance to work on a simulated client project after receiving an A in the course, I jumped at the chance to practice working with clients, improve my time management abilities, and apply efficient work processes. This project was a crucial learning experience for me as a front-end developer that provided priceless insights into the practical aspects of web development.
